# APIs & Libraries

Arcsecond.io is a software *system*. Behind the webapp available on any navigator, there are various other
associated services and projects.

* [APIs](./apis.md) - our backend RESTful APIs.
* [aa-js](./aa-js.md) - our open-source library of astronomical algorithms in Typescript.
* [CLI](./cli.md) - our open-source Command-Line Interface (a.k.a. the `arcsecond` terminal command).

## Support services & repositories

In addition to that, we've put in place an external [Status Page](https://status.arcsecond.io) which monitor the
availability of the various parts of our system, and send us alerts when something becomes unreachable.

On GitHub we also published a [repository](https://github.com/arcsecond-io/standard-stars-catalogues) where 17
catalogues of standard stars were formatted and unified. These are
catalogues found in the various pages of the websites of
[ESO](https://www.eso.org/sci/observing/tools/standards.html),
[Keck](https://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/common/landolt_stds.html),
[UKIRT](http://www.ukirt.hawaii.edu/astronomy/),
[Gemini](https://www.gemini.edu/sciops/instruments/gmos/calibration/photometric-stds),
[IAC](http://catserver.ing.iac.es/landscape/index.php) and the
[NOT](http://www.not.iac.es/observing/forms/landscape/v1.4/www/).

There's also a public issues repository (but it isn't much used, people prefer to reach us directly).

## Contact

And finally, we are reachable for any question, suggestions or bug reports in multiple ways:

* Our email is [team@arcsecond.io](mailto:team@arcsecond.io)
* We have a [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/arcsecond-io/shared_invite/zt-yvsehzjl-jExYLVWzwuslMJum7r2GiA) (open and free)

Sorry, we don't use our Twitter/X account anymore, considering the awful state of this platform.
