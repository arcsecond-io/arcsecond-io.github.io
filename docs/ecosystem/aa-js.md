# aa-js

AA.js is an open-source library written in Typescript in which numerous astronomical algorithms are implemented *and
tested*. These algorithms represent the backbone of the science and astronomical computations we perform in the webapp
of Arcsecond.io.

Discover [aa-js](https://github.com/arcsecond-io/aa-js) on GitHub.

They have originally been built based on the experience accumulated in creating
the [SwiftAA](https://github.com/onekiloparsec/SwiftAA) library in Swift.
