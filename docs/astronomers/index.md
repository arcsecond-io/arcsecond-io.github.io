# Nights Domain

The Nights Domain comprises all the features Arcsecond offers for exploring
planning, and observing.

## Night Explorer

<img style="float: left; align: top; margin-right: 1rem;" width="60" src="/icons/icon-telescope.svg"/> 

[Night Explorer](/astronomers/nights/explorer/), formerly known as **iObserve**, the best pro tools to explore observing
nights. Already used by thousands of astronomers worldwide (and even some classrooms!)

## Night Plans & Rule Sets

<img style="float: left; align: top; margin-right: 1rem;" width="60" src="/icons/icon-nightplan.svg"/> 

[Night Plans](/astronomers/nights/plans/) are the whole new Observations Planner of Arcsecond. Night Plans allow to
record linear sequences of targets, with their expected explosure time, in a given observing site and telescope.

<img style="float: left; align: top; margin-right: 1rem;" width="60" src="/icons/icon-ruleset.svg"/> 

[Rule Sets](/astronomers/nights/plans/rulesets.md) are custom rules to be attached to Observing Sites, Telescopes,
regular Targets or Transiting Exoplanets. Then can be used then to automatically sequence your Night Plans.
`in preparation!`

## Night Logs

[Night Logs](/astronomers/nights/logs/) are the executed plans! They record the actual sequence of observations
performed. Data Files can be easily associated with every observation.

# Targets Domain

## Follow-Up Targets

<img style="float: left; align: top; margin-right: 1rem;" width="60" src="/icons/icon-star.svg"/> 

[Follow-Up Targets](/astronomers/targets/followup/) are the targets that have been observed. Arcsecond maintains the
list from the created
Night Logs and those reconstructed from uploaded data.

## Target Lists

<img style="float: left; align: top; margin-right: 1rem;" width="60" src="/icons/icon-targetlist.svg"/> 

[Target Lists](/astronomers/targets/targetlists/) are lists of targets grouped by common interest. They can be directly
created from /
imported to the Night Explorer, and used to create Night Plans, Night Logs etc.

## Exoplanet Transits

<img style="float: left; align: top; margin-right: 1rem;" width="60" src="/icons/icon-exoplanet.svg"/> 

[Exoplanet Transits](/astronomers/targets/transits/) are the subset of exoplanets known for transiting in
front of their host star.
Arcsecond builds a powerful table and visualisation of transits for any date, and observing site of your choice.

## Known Bright Objects

<img style="float: left; align: top; margin-right: 1rem;" width="60" src="/icons/icon-galaxy.png"/> 

[Known Bright Objects](/astronomers/targets/tonight/) are the objects you can easily observe **tonight**. This feature
is
still `in preparation`.

# Data Domain

## Datasets & Data Storages

<img style="float: left; align: top; margin-right: 1rem;" width="60" src="/icons/icon-dataset.svg"/> 

[Datasets](/astronomers/data/datasets) are the virtual folders containing data. They allow to group (and easily
download) data files
which have a common source or interest.

[Cloud Storage](/astronomers/data/cloud-storage) is the unlimited, secured-by-default, deletion-protected,
industry-grade storage Arcsecond offers, based on Amazon's AWS S3.

[External Storages](/astronomers/data/external-storages) are storages that an astronomer, or an Observatory Portal
owns, or has access to. By providing secured read-only credentials, Arcsecond will use it to consolidate the Follow-Up
Targets list (and past Night Logs too).

## Data Packages

<img style="float: left; align: top; margin-right: 1rem;" width="60" src="/icons/icon-datapackage.svg"/> 

[Data Packages](/astronomers/data/datapackages) are custom packages of Datasets to be shared, either within an
Observatory Portal (e.g. for visiting observers), or with other astronomers, or to the public.

## Data & File Browser

<img style="float: left; align: top; margin-right: 1rem;" width="60" src="/icons/icon-datafile.svg"/> 

[File Browser](/astronomers/data/filebrowser) is a browser of all Data files associated with an account or an
Observatory Portal (being Arcsecond's Cloud storage or External Storages).
