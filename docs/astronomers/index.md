# Nights Domain

The Nights Domain comprises all the features Arcsecond offers for exploring
planning, and observing:

## Night Explorer

[Night Explorer](/astronomers/nights/explorer/), formerly known as **iObserve**, the best pro tools to explore observing
nights. Already used by thousands of astronomers worldwide (and even some classrooms!)

## Night Plans & Rule Sets

[Night Plans](/astronomers/nights/plans/) are the whole new Observations Planner of Arcsecond. Night Plans allow to
record linear sequences of targets, with their expected explosure time, in a given observing site and telescope.

[Rule Sets](/astronomers/nights/plans/rulesets.md) are custom rules to be attached to Observing Sites, Telescopes,
regular Targets or Transiting Exoplanets. Then can be used then to automatically sequence your Night Plans.

## Night Logs

[Night Logs](/astronomers/nights/logs/) are the executed plans! They record the actual sequence of observations
performed. Data Files can be easily associated with every observation.
