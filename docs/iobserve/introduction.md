# iObserve

iObserve is our Master Pro Tool. Its purpose is to provide a consistent application for preparing astronomical
observations. It can be decomposed into 7 parts.

## Times Bar & Location Selector

The Times Bar display the current time in various units. From left to right, the first three times are
location-independant:

* System/Computer Time "Now"
* UT Time
* Julian Date

Next, comes the location-dependant times:

* Local (absent if no time zone is available - see below)
* LMST (Local Mean Sidereal Time) - the so-called "Sun Time"

These two times are directly related to the chosen location, which can be set in different ways.

First the dropdown menu can be used to search in the Arcsecond Encyclopedia of Observing Sites. At the top of the list
will appear also Favorites Sites. These latter are sites defined by the user in his/her settings.

If a custom location is required, it can be determined using the complete Location Selector modal that opens up when
clicking the compass button.
