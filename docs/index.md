**Arcsecond** is a unique and comprehensive cloud platform made by 
astronomers for astronomers providing all the necessary resources and tools for 
preparing astronomical observations.

It is composed of professional tools that help preparing astronomical
observations. The most advanced and well-known of these tools is iObserve
(which was a native macOS app in the past). But other Pro Tools also include an
explorer of Exoplanet Transits, a simulator of satellite (Starlink!)
tracks on the sky, various converters etc.

For Observatories, Arcsecond offer 
[professional portals](https://www.arcsecond.io/portals) dedicated to Data
Storage and Data Management. Upload to Arcsecond is made easy thanks to our
uploader Oort, mentionned above. Arcsecond uses secured Amazon S3 buckets as
storage backend, and offer on top of that an easy-to-use interface for searching
among data, but also organising and packaging multiple data files and datasets.
It is designed to make easy to collect observation and calibration data of the
night, and to group them for an easier distribution.

All of Arcsecond is based on rigorous and numerous 
[REST APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer), 
which makes it easy to integrate with any custom workflows, especially with the
help of the CLI/Python module mentioned above.
