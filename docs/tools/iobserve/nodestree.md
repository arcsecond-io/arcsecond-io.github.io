# Nodes Tree & Object Imports

The Nodes Tree is a key component of iObserve, as it holds the organisation of targets into folders. Note that public &
free access to iObserve has a restricted number of nodes, and no folders.

## Action Buttons

The action buttons allow to import targets, create folders, change options & layout, and (depending on options)
open/close the right-pane info slide over.

:::info
The little icon to the right of the "Targets" title indicates whether the nodes tree is in sync with its remote. See
below for more about sync management.
