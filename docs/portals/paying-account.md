# Paying Account

One of the member of an Observatory Portal must be chosen as the paying account for activating module. The paying
account is receiving all Stripe- and billing-related communication (invoices etc).

If the creator of the portal is not the paying account, he/she must invite the person in charge to open a free
Arcsecond account. The creation of a dedicated account is entirely free.

Once the paying account has been created, to fulfill the requirements:

- The primary email address must have been verified (in the *Settings* of the account itself).
- The account role must be set to `supermadin` in the portal members table.
- Finally, a payment method must be added, by clicking the "Stripe" button in the portal "Billing" page.
