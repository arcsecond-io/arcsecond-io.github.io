# Paying Account

:::warning
Documentation for the coming Arcsecond V4
:::

In order to activate Portal Modules, a paying account must be chosen. If the creator of the portal is not the paying
account, he/she must invite the person in charge to open a free Arcsecond account.

Then, two conditions must be met for a paying account:

- It must have a `supermadin` role in the portal.
- The primary email address must have been verified (in the *Settings* of the account).

Then, a payment method must be added, by clicking the "Stripe" button in the portal "Billing" page.
