# Paying Account

In order to active Portal Modules, a paying account must be chosen. If the creator of the portal is not the paying
account, it must invite the person in charge to open a free Arcsecond account.

Then, two conditions must be met for a paying account:

- It must have a `supermadin` role in the portal.
- The primary email address must have been verified (in the *Settings* of the account).

Then, a payment method must be added. Here is the procedure:

1. Login to the portal (or to Arcsecond itself and switch to the portal)
2. Navigate to the "Billing" Page (accessible to the *Admin* dropdown menu)
3. Click the "Open Stripe Billing Portal" button, and follow the instructions to add a Payment method.
4. Navigate to the "Members" Page (accessible to the *Admin* dropdown menu)
5. Designate the account as the Paying account (this is not automatic to let people choose different accounts if
   needed).

The Portal Modules then become available for activation.
