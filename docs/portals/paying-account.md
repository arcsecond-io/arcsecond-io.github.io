# Paying Account

In order to active Portal Modules, a paying account must be chosen. The two following conditions must be met for such
account:

- It must have a `supermadin` role in the portal.
- Its primary email address must have been verified (in the *Settings* of the personal account).

Then, a payment method must be added. Here is the procedure:

1. Login to the portal (or to the standard Arcsecond and switch to the portal)
2. Navigate to the "Billing" Page (accessible to the *Admin* dropdown)
3. Click the "Open Stripe Billing Portal" button, and follow the instructions to add a Payment method.
4. Navigate to the "Members" Page (accessible to the *Admin* dropdown)
5. Designate the account as the Paying account.

The Portal Modules then become available for activation.
