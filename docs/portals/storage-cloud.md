# Arcsecond Cloud Storage

Every Observatory Portal comes with the [Arcsecond Cloud Storage](../observations/cloud-storage.md) by default. It is
free until it reaches 50GB. It can be used to store any astronomical data, as well as FITS and XISF (1D and 2D)
previews.

An unlimited number of External Storages can also be attached to an Observatory Portal. See
the [Data & Observations section](../observations/).
