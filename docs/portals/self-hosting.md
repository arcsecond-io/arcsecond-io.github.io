# Self-Hosting Arcsecond

Creating a self-hosting packaging of the whole Arcsecond system, while the SaaS version is being expanded is not an easy
task. Great progresses have been made in the last months, and we stay committed to achieve such delivery.

As of today (July 2024), it is too early to announce anything. Nonetheless, our plan is to continue under the same
principles: same code, same features, same price.
