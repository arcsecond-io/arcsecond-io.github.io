# Registration

The registration of a portal is not yet automatic, because a DNS entry must be made for the subdomain. 
Please [write us an email](mailto:team@arcsecond.io) and we will very happy to diligently open a portal for you.

A free period between 1 and 3 months can be made for you familiarize yourself, explore and test before adopting
Arcsecond.

In the future, it will be possible to create the portal, with its subdomain, right from the web.
