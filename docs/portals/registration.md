# Observatory Portal Registration

Here is the procedure to create a portal:

1. Login to [Arcsecond](https://www.arcsecond.io),
2. Open your *Setting* Page, in the "[Memberships](https://www.arcsecond.io/profile#memberships)" tab,
3. Click "Create Observatory Portal" button to open the modal,
4. Choose a subdomain and click "Create"!...

Your portal will be automatically created, along with your `superadmin` membership. You will be redirected
immediately to it. From your portal, you will be able to invite other colleagues, entirely for free.

The creation of portals is entirely free, and can be tested (no credit card needed). Feel
free to [contact us](mailto:team@arcsecond.io) for more details or a demo

## First steps

Once an Observatory Portal is created, what are the things you can freely do:

- Create one or more observing sites, or associate existing ones, if any.
- Use the free mode of Night Explorer with it, and create some Target Lists.
- Create a Night Plan, a Night Log (in the future, some Rule Sets too) to explore how it works.
- Play with the Exoplanet Transit browser, and append specific Exoplanets to your Night Plan.
- You can create / associate one or more Telescope, upload some data, and see Arcsecond build the beginning of your
  Follow-Up Targets.
- Create a Data Package, and make it public to see it displayed in your customized public home page.
- Create some events in the Observatory Schedule, associated with one of your telescope, and see how customizable the
  calendar can be.
- Finally, drop us a line to tell us what you think, or ask even more advanced features!
