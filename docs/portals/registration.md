# Observatory Portal Registration

Here is the procedure to create a portal:

1. Login to [Arcsecond](https://www.arcsecond.io),
2. Open your *Setting* Page, in the "[Memberships](https://www.arcsecond.io/profile#memberships)" tab,
3. Click "Create Observatory Portal" button to open the modal,
4. Choose a subdomain and click "Create"!...

Your portal will be automatically created, along with your `superadmin` membership. You will be redirected
immediately to it. From your portal, you will be able to invite other colleagues, entirely for free.

The creation of portals is entirely free, and can be tested around (with a limit of 50GB of data). Feel
free to [contact us](mailto:team@arcsecond.io) for more details or a demo
