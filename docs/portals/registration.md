The registration of a new Observatory Portal will soon be available to anyone, with Arcsecond V4 planned for early 2023.

Here is the procedure to create a portal:

1. Login to Arcsecond.
2. Open your *Setting* Page, in the "Memberships" tab.

Your portal will be automatically created, along with your superadmin membership, and you will be redirected immediately
to it.
