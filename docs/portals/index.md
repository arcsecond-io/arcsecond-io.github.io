# Introduction

> "All astronomical observatories in the world have in common the needs to prepare and plan
> observations, organise and execute night operations, then store, package and distribute data."

Arcsecond's **Observatory Portals** allow every observatory, science
group, university, planetarium, astro club or any organisation, to store and build the history of their
Observatory. It is a dedicated space with an unlimited number of members, easy membership permissions and
capabilities, where one can handle all the activities associated with astronomical observations, in a modular
way.

ICONS

We are very proud to have been already entrusted by 3 organisations on multiple continents: OMA in Chile, ARIEL-Survey
(between France and Tasmania) and the Montréal Planétarium (Espace pour la Vie, Canada).

## Portals specific features

In addition to the Astronomer's Domain (Night Explorer with Night Plans and Night Logs, Datasets and Data Storage, as
well as Data Packages), Observatory Portals offer the following:

- **An unlimited number of members, at no additional charge**, with an easy-to-manage 5-levels permission scheme to
  easily control who is doing what, and has access to what.
- An Observatory Schedule, to manage what is happening in your Observatory over time. The schedule can be customized
  between a standard calendar mode, a telescopes timeline or an observers timeline. It includes sophisticated recurring
  events.
- 100GB of free Data Storage to start with Finding Charts & Data Previews (instead of 50GB for astronomers).
- A customizable public page.
- A dedicated subdomain, under the Arcsecond umbrella.

## Important notes

If you need a dedicated cloud infrastructure for your portal, <a href="mailto:team@arcsecond.io" target="_blank">contact
us</a>.

Likewise, data are stored in the U.S. by default. But if you need or prefer a default storage in another region, we will
be happy to set it up for you.
