# Introduction

> "All astronomical observatories in the world have in common the needs to prepare and plan
> observations, organise and execute night operations, then store, package and distribute data."

Arcsecond's **Observatory Portals** allow every observatory, science
group, university, planetarium, astro club to handle all the activities associated with astronomical
observations, in a modular way. It is a dedicated space with an unlimited number of members, easy membership
permissions and capabilities, where one can store and build a modern data archive based on APIs, and further
more the whole life and history of an Observatory

[ICONS]

We are very proud to have been already entrusted by 3 organisations on multiple continents: OMA in Chile, ARIEL-Survey
(between France and Tasmania) and the Montréal Planétarium (Espace pour la Vie, Canada).

## Portals specific features

First, Arcsecond's Observatory Portals offer **to all its members** the same coverage of the astronomical observations'
lifecycle: *Explore, Plan, Observe, Store, Distribute*.

In addition, Arcsecond's Observatory Portals offer the following:

- A unique place to record the history of all observations, observers, targets and observing nights, and build the data
  archive of your Observatory, even if you have existing data located elsewhere.
- **An unlimited number of members, at no additional charge**, with an easy-to-manage 5-levels permission scheme to
  easily control who is doing what, and has access to what.
- The possibility to easily share data with the public, with a customizable public page,
- An Observatory Schedule, to manage what is happening in your Observatory over time. The schedule can be customized
  between a standard calendar mode, a telescopes timeline or an observers timeline, including recurring
  events.
- 100GB of free Data Storage to start with Finding Charts & Data Previews (instead of 50GB for astronomers).
- A dedicated subdomain, under the Arcsecond umbrella.

## Important notes

If you want Arcsecond to set up a dedicated cloud infrastructure specifically for your
portal, <a href="mailto:team@arcsecond.io" target="_blank">contact us</a>.

Likewise, data are stored in the U.S. by default. But if you need or prefer a default storage in another region, we will
be happy to set it up for you.
