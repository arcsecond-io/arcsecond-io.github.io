# Introduction

The ambition of Arcsecond is to offer professional-quality software for astronomers and observatories to manage data,
execute night operations and perform the best astronomical observations possible. It is built on top of years of
experience of professional software development following a 10-years period of astronomical research, and especially 4
years spent in Chile, working for ESO at the La Silla Observatory.

Arcsecond was initiated to bring to the web a well-known macOS app, called iObserve. It is now expanding to offer
observatories powerful portals, and work not only in the cloud, but it will soon also work in self-hosted environments.

This documentation is about Observatory Portals only. The other documentations of Arcsecond can be found in the
[Root Docs](https://docs.arcsecond.io).

# OMA

OMA stands for "[Observatorio Mancomunado de Astrof√≠sica](https://oma.astrofisicamas.cl)". It is a consortium
of Chilean Universities, coordinated by the Millennium Institute of Astrophysics (MAS) that operates a telescope located
in [El Sauce Observatory](https://www.arcsecond.io/observingsites/1003d9eb-5f4b-4b16-81f4-1529e52e0959),
in the Atacama desert.

OMA is the first Observatory Portal of Arcsecond, and is used throughout this documentation to illustrate it with
images taken in real conditions.
