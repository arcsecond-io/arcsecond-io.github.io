It allows to reduce the perimeter of the Arcsecond webapp to 3 different levels:</p><ul><li><strong>Full Arcsecond</strong> (default). This is the full Arcsecond site, with all its pages.</li><li><strong>Night Explorer</strong> This mode focuses Arcsecond to Night Explorer (a.k.a. iObserve) only. It basically transforms Arcsecond into Night Explorer app. It will re-route the homepage to Night Explorer, remove most of the standard app routes, and leave the Night Explorer app only (with the few necessary auxiliary pages).

It focuses Arcsecond to only the Nights domain: Night Explorer, Night Plans, Rule Sets &amp; Night Logs. It will hide the Targets and Data domains.</li></ul><p>For the last two modes, some auxiliary pages (such as the Observing Sites encyclopedia) remain nonetheless visible.
